#### **Computer network**

- A collection of interconnected devices that share resources and communicate using standard protocols.

#### **OSI model**

- A framework that divides networking into 7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

#### **TCP vs UDP**

- **TCP** is reliable and connection-oriented. **UDP** is faster, connectionless, and less reliable.

#### **IP Address**

- A unique identifier for devices on a network, used for routing data between them.

#### **IPv4 vs IPv6**

- **IPv4**: 32-bit, supports 4.3 billion devices. **IPv6**: 128-bit, supports a vastly larger number of devices.

#### **MAC Address**

- A unique hardware identifier for network devices used at the Data Link Layer.

#### **DNS (Domain Name System)**

- Translates domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses for communication.

#### **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**

- Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices in a network, simplifying management.

#### **Subnet Mask**

- Defines the network and host portions of an IP address, aiding in efficient IP address allocation.

#### **Router vs Switch**

- **Router**: Connects multiple networks and routes data between them.
- **Switch**: Connects devices within a network, forwarding data based on MAC addresses.

#### **Hub vs Switch**

- **Hub**: Broadcasts data to all devices.
- **Switch**: Directs data to the intended recipient.

#### **Firewall**

- Controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules, protecting against unauthorized access.

#### **NAT (Network Address Translation)**

- Translates private IP addresses to a public one, allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP.

#### **Static vs Dynamic IP Addressing**

- **Static**: Manually assigned and permanent.
- **Dynamic**: Automatically assigned via DHCP and can change over time.

#### **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**

- Creates an encrypted tunnel for secure communication over a public network like the internet.

#### **Three-Way Handshake (TCP)**

- Used to establish a TCP connection: SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets are exchanged to confirm readiness.

#### **Proxy Server**

- Acts as an intermediary between client and server, often used for security, caching, and anonymity.

#### **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**

- Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses, enabling devices to communicate on a local network.

#### **Latency**

- The delay between sending and receiving data, measured in milliseconds (ms).

#### **Bandwidth**

- The maximum rate of data transfer across a network, measured in bits per second (bps).

#### **Throughput**

- The actual rate of successful data transfer, often lower than bandwidth due to network conditions.

#### **Packet Loss**

- Occurs when one or more packets fail to reach their destination due to network issues.

#### **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)**

- A logical grouping of devices within a network, improving segmentation and security.

#### **Socket**

- An endpoint for communication, identified by an IP address and port number, facilitating data transfer between devices.

#### **Port Forwarding**

- Maps external traffic to a specific internal IP and port, allowing access to services on a private network.

#### **Load Balancer**

- Distributes traffic across multiple servers to enhance performance and reliability.

#### **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**

- Used for error reporting and diagnostic functions like `ping` to check connectivity.

#### **Traceroute**

- A tool that shows the path packets take from one device to another, used for troubleshooting network issues.

#### **SSL/TLS**

- Security protocols that encrypt data sent over the internet, ensuring secure communication.

#### **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**

- A network of distributed servers that deliver web content from locations closer to users for faster access.

#### **QoS (Quality of Service)**

- Techniques to prioritize certain types of traffic (e.g., VoIP) to ensure high performance for critical applications.

#### **Collision Domain vs Broadcast Domain**

- **Collision Domain**: A network segment where data collisions can occur.
- **Broadcast Domain**: A network segment where broadcast traffic is received by all devices.

#### **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**

- A protocol used to exchange routing information between different networks on the internet.

#### **DNS Server**

- Resolves domain names into IP addresses, enabling access to websites via human-readable names.

#### **Half-Duplex vs Full-Duplex**

- **Half-Duplex**: Data flows in one direction at a time.
- **Full-Duplex**: Data flows in both directions simultaneously.

#### **Multicast**

- Sends data to multiple devices in a group, more efficient than sending individual unicast messages.

#### **Internet vs Intranet**

- **Internet**: Global public network.
- **Intranet**: Private network within an organization.

#### **Strongly Connected Components in Graph**

- A component of a directed graph where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex in that component.

#### **Bridges in Graph**

- A bridge is an edge in a graph, whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.

#### **Traceroute and Ping Difference**

- **Ping**: Measures the round-trip time for packets.
- **Traceroute**: Shows the path packets take between devices, useful for troubleshooting.
