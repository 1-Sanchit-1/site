### What is DBMS and what is its utility? Explain RDBMS with examples.

- **DBMS (Database Management System)** is software that manages and organizes data efficiently. It allows users to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in databases. Its utility lies in providing a structured way to handle large amounts of data with security and control.

- **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)** is a type of DBMS that organizes data into tables (relations) with rows and columns. Examples include MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server. These systems use SQL (Structured Query Language) for managing data and relationships between tables.

### Mention the issues with traditional file-based systems that make DBMS a better choice?

- **Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:** In file systems, duplicate data might exist, leading to inconsistencies.
- **Data Isolation:** Files are stored in different locations, making data sharing and access difficult.
- **Lack of Security:** Traditional file systems have limited control over who can access and modify data.
- **Concurrency Issues:** File-based systems struggle with handling multiple users accessing the same data at the same time.

### Explain a few advantages of a DBMS.

- **Data Integrity:** Ensures accuracy and consistency of data through rules and constraints.
- **Data Security:** Provides controlled access to data, allowing only authorized users to access or modify it.
- **Reduced Redundancy:** Minimizes duplicate data, improving storage efficiency.
- **Backup and Recovery:** DBMS provides mechanisms for data recovery in case of failure.
- **Concurrency Control:** Allows multiple users to access data simultaneously without issues.

### Explain different languages present in DBMS.

- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Used to define database structure (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Deals with data retrieval and manipulation (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- **DCL (Data Control Language):** Manages access to the database (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** Handles transactions within the database (e.g., COMMIT, ROLLBACK).

### What is meant by ACID properties in DBMS?

ACID properties ensure safe and reliable transactions in a DBMS:

- **Atomicity:** Ensures that all operations in a transaction either complete or none do.
- **Consistency:** Guarantees that transactions lead to a valid state according to the database's rules.
- **Isolation:** Ensures that transactions do not interfere with each other.
- **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent, even after a system failure.

### What is meant by normalization and denormalization?

- **Normalization:** Organizing data into multiple related tables to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- **Denormalization:** Combining related tables into a single table to improve read performance, but it can lead to redundancy.

### What is a lock? Explain the major difference between a shared lock and an exclusive lock during a transaction in a database.

- **Lock:** A mechanism that controls access to data during transactions to maintain consistency.
- **Shared Lock:** Multiple transactions can read the data but cannot modify it.
- **Exclusive Lock:** Only one transaction can read and write the data, blocking other transactions from accessing it.

### **delete vs truncate vs drop**

| Feature                 | DELETE                              | TRUNCATE                       | DROP                              |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Operation**           | Removes specific rows               | Removes all rows from a table  | Removes the entire table          |
| **Use of WHERE clause** | Yes (can filter specific rows)      | No (removes all rows)          | No (removes the whole table)      |
| **Rollback (Undo)**     | Yes (supports transaction rollback) | No (cannot rollback)           | No (cannot rollback)              |
| **Performance**         | Slower (removes rows one by one)    | Faster (removes rows directly) | Fastest (removes table structure) |
| **Space Reclamation**   | Does not free up space immediately  | Frees up space immediately     | Frees up space immediately        |
| **DDL/DML**             | DML (Data Manipulation Language)    | DDL (Data Definition Language) | DDL (Data Definition Language)    |

### Explain tiers architecture in a DBMS.

1. **1-Tier Architecture (Single-Tier)**:

   - **Description**: The database and the user interact directly on the same machine.
   - **Example**: Database developer works directly on the DBMS.
   - **Key Points**:
     - No client-server architecture.
     - Not suitable for end-users.
     - Mostly used for development or local database management.

2. **2-Tier Architecture (Client-Server)**:

   - **Description**: The client interacts with the database through an application.
   - **Example**: A desktop application (client) connects to a database server.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Client sends requests to the database server.
     - Server processes and sends data back.
     - Faster than 3-tier but less secure.

3. **3-Tier Architecture**:
   - **Description**: Has three layers â€“ Presentation (UI), Application (Logic), and Database (Data Storage).
   - **Example**: A web application where users interact through a web browser (UI), a server processes logic, and data is stored in a database.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Most common for web applications.
     - Better security and scalability.
     - The client interacts with the application server, which then communicates with the database server.
