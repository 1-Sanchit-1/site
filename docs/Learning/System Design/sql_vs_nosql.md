The difference between **SQL (Structured Query Language)** and **NoSQL (Not Only SQL)** databases lies in their structure, scalability, and the way data is stored and queried.

### SQL Databases:

1. **Structured Data**: SQL databases use a fixed schema, where data is stored in tables with rows and columns.
2. **ACID Compliance**: Ensures reliability with **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, **Isolation**, and **Durability**, making SQL databases a good choice for critical transactions.
3. **Joins & Relations**: Data in SQL databases can be related using **foreign keys**, which allow complex queries across multiple tables (joins).
4. **Scalability**: Typically, SQL databases are **vertically scalable** (upgrading the hardware), though some modern SQL databases also support horizontal scaling.

### NoSQL Databases:

1. **Flexible Data Models**: NoSQL databases store data in a variety of formats, including **documents** (e.g., MongoDB), **key-value pairs** (e.g., Redis), **graphs** (e.g., Neo4j), or **column-based** (e.g., Cassandra). These allow for **schema-less** structures.
2. **Eventual Consistency**: Many NoSQL databases prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency (CAP theorem), providing **eventual consistency** instead of strong consistency.
3. **Horizontal Scalability**: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally across distributed servers, making them better for large-scale, distributed systems.
4. **Faster for Certain Operations**: NoSQL databases often provide faster read and write operations for specific tasks, especially in high-throughput systems.

### When to Use SQL:

- **Structured Data**: When your data is highly structured and the relationships between data are well-defined.
- **Consistency is Critical**: When ACID transactions are required (e.g., financial applications).
- **Complex Queries**: When you need to perform complex queries, such as joins between multiple tables.

### When to Use NoSQL:

- **Unstructured or Semi-Structured Data**: Ideal when dealing with large volumes of unstructured data (e.g., logs, social media data).
- **High-Speed, High-Volume Operations**: For scenarios where speed is crucial and the data structure is flexible, such as in real-time analytics or caching systems.
- **Scalability**: When you need to handle massive data loads across distributed systems (e.g., large-scale applications like social networks).
